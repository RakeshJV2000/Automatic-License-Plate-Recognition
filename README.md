# Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition

- Fine-tuned YOLOv8 model to track the license plates in video frames - obtained a Mean Average Precision(mAP) of 92%.
- Applied image preprocessing techniques, including noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and histogram equalization, to optimize the clarity of license plates, which improved the accuracy by 25% in extracting the texts.
- Utilized Optical Character Recognition(OCR) library in Python to extract texts from number plates and developed a script to save
the results to a CSV file automatically
